## Getting Started 

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run this project the TypeScriptCompiler is required.

```
npm install -g typescript

You'll also require BrowserSync for live reloading.

```
npm install -g browser-sync
```

### Installing

To get the project up and running be sure to watch local files for changes by executing the build command, this can be done by pressing ⌘CMD+⇧SHIFT+B.

Next up we'll want our project to be reloaded everytime the built javascript is changed, this can be done by executing the following command.

Make sure to execute this command in the /dist directory and not the root folder.

```
